Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science and more specifically, 
the branch of artificial intelligence or AI concerned with giving computers the ability to understand 
text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.

NLP combines computational linguistics rule based modeling of human language with statistical, 
machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process 
human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the 
speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken 
commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time. There’s a good chance you’ve 
interacted with NLP in the form of voice operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech to text 
dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a 
growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee 
productivity, and simplify mission critical business processes.

NLP tasks
a)Speech recognition, also called speech to text, is the task of reliably converting voice data into text 
data,

b)Part of speech tagging, also called grammatical tagging, is the process of determining the part of 
speech of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context,

c)Word sense disambiguation is the selection of the meaning of a word with multiple meanings through a 
process of semantic analysis that determine the word that makes the most sense in the given context,

d)Named entity recognition, or NEM, identifies words or phrases as useful entities,

e)Co reference resolution is the task of identifying if and when two words refer to the same entity,

f)Sentiment analysis attempts to extract subjective qualities attitudes, emotions, sarcasm, confusion, 
suspicion from text,

g)Natural language generation is sometimes described as the opposite of speech recognition or 
speech to text; it's the task of putting structured information into human language.

NLP tools and approaches
The Python programing language provides a wide range of tools and libraries for attacking specific NLP 
tasks: the Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK, includes libraries for many of the NLP tasks listed above, 
plus libraries for subtasks, such as 
sentence parsing, word segmentation, stemming and lemmatization (methods of trimming words down to their 
roots), and tokenization (for breaking phrases, sentences, paragraphs and passages into tokens that 
help the computer better understand the text).

Statistical NLP, machine learning, and deep learning
Statistical NLP, which combines computer algorithms with machine learning and deep learning models 
to automatically extract, classify, and label elements of text and voice data and then assign a 
statistical likelihood to each possible meaning of those elements.

NLP use cases
a)Spam detection: You may not think of spam detection as an NLP solution, but the best spam detection 
technologies use NLP's text classification capabilities to scan emails for language that often indicates 
spam or phishing,

b)Machine translation: Effective translation has to capture accurately the meaning and tone of the input language and 
translate it to text with the same meaning and desired impact in the output language,

c)Virtual agents and chatbots: Virtual agents such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa use speech 
recognition to recognize patterns in voice commands and natural language generation to respond with 
appropriate action or helpful comments,

d)Social media sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis can analyze language used in social media posts, 
responses, reviews, and more to extract attitudes and emotions in response to products, promotions, and 
events–information companies can use in product designs, advertising campaigns, and more,

e)Text summarization: Text summarization uses NLP techniques to digest huge volumes of digital text and 
create summaries and synopses for indexes, research databases, or busy readers who don't have time to 
read full text.

Natural language processing and IBM Watson
IBM has innovated in the artificial intelligence space by pioneering NLP driven tools and services that 
enable organizations to automate their complex business processes while gaining essential business 
insights.

Watson Discovery
a)Surface high quality answers and rich insights from your complex enterprise documents 
tables, PDFs, big data and more with AI search.Enable your employees to make more informed decisions 
and save time with real time search engine and text mining capabilities that perform text extraction and 
analyze relationships and patterns buried in unstructured data.
c)Watson Discovery leverages custom NLP 
models and machine learning methods to provide users with AI that understands the unique language of 
their industry and business.

Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
a)Analyze text in unstructured data formats including HTML, 
webpages, social media, and more,

b)Increase your understanding of human language by leveraging this 
natural language tool kit to identify concepts, keywords, categories, semantics, and emotions, and to 
perform text classification, entity extraction, named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and 
summarization.

Watson Assistant
a)Improve the customer experience while reducing costs,

b)Watson Assistant is an AI chatbot 
with an easy to use visual builder so you can deploy virtual agents across any channel, in minutes.

Purpose built for healthcare and life sciences domains, IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data extracts 
key clinical concepts from natural language text, like conditions, medications, allergies and procedures. 
Deep contextual insights and values for key clinical attributes develop more meaningful data. Potential 
data sources include clinical notes, discharge summaries, clinical trial protocols and literature data.
